# Preface

### 2024-10-24: Site is being gradually updated. See GitHub for changes and feel free to contribute.


This site will introduce you to basic methods to learn Japanese and useful, community-approved tools you can use in the
process.
It is directed at people who want to learn Japanese efficiently through **self-study** and have a **passion for Japanese
media** such as anime, manga and visual novels.

If you have questions of any sort feel free to ask in the #beginner-questions chanel of the [Discord
server](https://animecards.site/discord/) or check out the [contact page](support.md) for more ways to contact me.

All steps are applicable to both Windows and Linux. All software is free. No paid products or services are offered.
