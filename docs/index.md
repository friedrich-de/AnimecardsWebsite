# Preface

### 2024-02-24: The contents of this site are currently a bit outdated. It's still useful for the ideas it presents and some of the tools presented here so feel free to still use it. There will be some updates soon with new tools and resources. Have any suggestions?

This site will introduce you to basic methods to learn Japanese and useful, community-approved tools you can use in the
process.
It is directed at people who want to learn Japanese efficiently through **self-study** and have a **passion for Japanese
media** such as anime, manga and visual novels.

If you have questions of any sort feel free to ask in the #join-chat of the Discord

All steps are applicable to both Windows and Linux. All software is free. No paid products or services are offered.
