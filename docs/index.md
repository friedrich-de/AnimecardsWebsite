If you're eager to learn Japanese through immersion, you're in the right place.

Japanese learners are at the forefront of language acquisition, employing sophisticated methods and software to learn at an unprecedented pace. Achieving JLPT N1 in just 1-2 years is a realistic goal with these techniques.

This site introduces you to community-approved methods and tools, especially for those **passionate about Japanese media** like anime, manga, and visual novels.

For questions or issues, feel free to ask in the `#beginner-questions` channel on our [Discord server](https://animecards.site/discord/) or on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/friedrich-de/AnimecardsWebsite).

These steps apply to Windows, Linux, and partly to macOS. All software mentioned is free. No Paid prodcuts or services are offered.
